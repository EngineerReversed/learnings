They communicate simply by sharing data, providing ensure of one thread at time, handled by the threading module. Threads share the process’s resources, including the heap space.

    "**Summary** : If your code is IO bound, both multiprocessing and multithreading in Python will work for you.<br> *Multithreading* can speed up process for network based operations(like web scraping - downloading multiple files). <br> *Multiprocessing* is a easier to just drop in than threading but has a higher memory overhead. If your code is CPU bound(writing lots of to hard disk, copying files etc.), multiprocessing is most likely going to be the better choice—especially if the target machine has multiple cores or CPUs."
